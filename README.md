# MNIST CNN Using Transfer Learning

Trained a CNN for digits 1,4,5,9 using Convolutional, pooling and softmax layers. Used this trained model's weights to classify the remaining 6 digits i.e 0,2,3,6,7,8. Additional layer was added to improve the accuracy.

Accuracy for 1459 network:   99.253%
Accuracy for 023678 network: 99.147%   

Also added code to check activations of convolutional and pooling layers, kernals for convolution layers and the execution graph.
